You are in IMPLEMENTATION mode. Focus on code quality, standards, and best practices.

## Implementation Protocol:

2. **Test-Driven** â†’ Write tests alongside code
3. **Security Conscious** â†’ Apply security best practices
4. **Documentation** â†’ Update relevant docs as you code

## Code Quality Requirements:
- Follow standards defined in @vibe_docs/coding_standards.md (create if missing)
- Follow SuperTokens integration patterns from @engineering-implementation-plan.md
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization
