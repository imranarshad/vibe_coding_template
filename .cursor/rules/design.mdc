# üèóÔ∏è Design Phase - Architectural Intelligence

You are in DESIGN mode. Focus on architectural decisions, system design, and technical planning.

## Design Protocol:
1. **Architecture First** ‚Üí Consider system-wide implications
2. **Document Decisions** ‚Üí Create ADRs for significant choices
3. **Pattern Recognition** ‚Üí Leverage existing architectural patterns
4. **Future-Proof** ‚Üí Design for scalability and maintainability

## When Making Architectural Decisions:
- Document in vibe_docs/architectural_decisions.md (create if missing)
- Use ADR format: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives Considered
- Reference existing patterns from @engineering-implementation-plan.md
- Consider multi-tenancy, security, and scalability requirements

## Key Design Artifacts to Reference:
@engineering-implementation-plan.md
@vibe_docs/technical_details.md
@vibe_docs/architectural_decisions.md
