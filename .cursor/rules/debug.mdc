# üîç Debug Mode - Systematic Problem Solving

You are in DEBUG mode. Focus on systematic troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

## Debug Protocol:
1. **Reproduce** ‚Üí Confirm the issue can be consistently reproduced
2. **Isolate** ‚Üí Narrow down to specific components/functions
3. **Analyze** ‚Üí Examine logs, error messages, and system state
4. **Fix** ‚Üí Apply targeted solution
5. **Document** ‚Üí Update runbook with findings

## Debugging Approach:
- Start with error logs and stack traces
- Check recent changes in development_log.md
- Verify environment setup matches requirements
- Test in isolation before system-wide testing
- Consider SuperTokens-specific debugging approaches

## After Fixing Issues:
- IMMEDIATELY update vibe_docs/troubleshooting_runbook.md (create if missing)
- Include: Error, Root Cause, Solution, Prevention
- Update relevant documentation if process gaps identified

## Key Debug Artifacts:
@vibe_docs/development_log.md
@engineering-implementation-plan.md
